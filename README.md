**Welcome to GitHub ‘GIDS Open Standaarden’**. Here we share open source components based on open standards that can help you make an Integral Digital Health System (GIDS) as envisioned in this [short video](https://vimeo.com/gidsopenstandaarden/sns). GIDS is made step by step in a way of working we call 'Community Based Development'. In GIDS Open Standaarden, various organizations work together on the overlap of their interests.

**Dutch developers and business people**: this initiative is described in more detail on our [website gidsopenstandaarden.org](https://www.gidsopenstandaarden.org). The stories told on our [blog gidsopenstandaarden.nl](https://blog.gidsopenstandaarden.nl) reflect the complexity of all interests in the Dutch healthcare landscape. You can make yourself a member on our [LinkedIn GIDS Open Standaarden](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gidsopenstandaarden) to follow our development.

**This GitHub provides software to enable shared functions**. In addition we provide code samples, test tools, relevant legal information and templates that help you to quickly implement the components in your software. Or help you implement our licensing policies easily as you make use of, or contribute to our project. 
The goal of our (technical) documentation is to help you spend as little time as possible figuring out what the implementation means for your organization. If you find ways to save more time or to make this easier, please help us and contribute. Use our [Signpost](https://github.com/GIDSOpenStandaarden/Signpost) for more details on our current open source components:

- Health Tools Interoperability
- Social Network Standard
- Security, privacy, legal documents and templates
- MedMij implementation building blocks

**We actively partner with others** who develop complementary open source components. Specifically with the [Nuts community](https://github.com/nuts-foundation) who create a decentralized communication network for healthcare that enables fast, safe, and cost-effective medical data sharing. [IRMA](https://github.com/privacybydesign) who provide open source software to authenticate identities using attribute based authentication. [Solid](https://solidproject.org) who are using web standards to let people control their data, and choose the applications and services to use with it. [HL7/FHIR](https://github.com/HL7) who provide open standards for Healthcare Interoperability. And [SURF](https://github.com/SURFnet) who have inspired us.
